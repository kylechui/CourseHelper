## TODO/Future Ideas
- [ ] Add user information file that contains list of completed courses
- [ ] Implement interactive command that allows the user to add/remove courses
  from both the "database" and their own list
- [ ] Implement command that gives the user a list of all classes that can be
  taken
- [ ] Implement command that gives the user information about a certain class:
  - [ ] Course ID/name/description
  - [ ] List of pre-requisite courses necessary to take that class
  - [ ] Whether or not the user can take that class, and if not, which courses
    are still needed to take it
- [ ] Visualizer for the course graph
- [ ] Web scraping to automatically generate the input data
